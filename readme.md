    In addition to the ReplyBot.php file you need a txt file. example txt file is included. You also need the twitteroauth php 
    library by Abraham Williams (https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth) If you are only using one Twitter account, you can put your credentials in this file. Else modify the 'user.php' include file with your twitter tokens. 
    And of course, a Twitter app.
