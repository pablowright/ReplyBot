Twitter Bot Written in php. 

    Search Twitter for words, users, hashtags, etc. and reply with whatever from a text file.
    Run from cron at an interval of your choosing. You might want to be careful not to run it too often
    or you risk annoying people.

    In addition to the ReplyBot.php file you need a txt file. Example txt file is included.
    You also need the twitteroauth php library by Abraham Williams (https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth).
    If you are only using one Twitter account, you can put your credentials in ReplyBot.php file directly. 
    Else modify the 'user.php' include file with your twitter tokens. 
    You of course, need a Twitter app. There are tutorials EVERYWHERE on setting this up.
